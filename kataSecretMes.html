    <h1>Kata: Jenny's secret message</h1>
    <h2>Open the console</h2>
    <p>Jenny has written a function that returns <br>
        a greeting for a user. However, she's in <br>
        love with Johnny, and would like to greet <br>
        him slightly different. She added a special <br>
        case to her function, but she made a mistake.<br>
        <br>
        Can you help her?</p>
